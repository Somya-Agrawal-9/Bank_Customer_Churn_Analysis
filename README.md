# Bank_Customer_Churn_Analysis
## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn data for a bank using **Microsoft Excel**.  
The objective is to identify patterns, risk factors, and key drivers of churn that can help in developing better customer retention strategies.

## Dashboard
The interactive Excel dashboard includes:
- Slicers for demographics (Age, Gender, Geography, Card Type)
- Churn trends by Credit Score, Age, Satisfaction, Tenure, and Product Type
- Visual KPIs (Total Customers, Churn Rate, Retention Rate, Avg Age, Avg Tenure, Avg Satisfaction)

## Key Insights
- **Churn Rate:** Around 20% (1 in 5 customers leaving).
- **Demographics:** Young customers (20–30 years) show highest churn (>25%), older customers (50+) are more stable.
- **Financial Behavior:** Customers with low credit scores (<500) churn >35%, while those with high scores (>750) churn <20%.
- **Products:** Customers with 1 product churn almost 3× higher than those with multiple products.
- **Satisfaction & Tenure:** Low satisfaction (1–2) and tenure 0–2 years have the highest churn (>30%).

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Charts, Slicers, Dashboard Design)
- Dataset: Bank customer churn dataset

## Outcomes
The analysis provides a clear view of the drivers behind customer churn and emphasizes the importance of early onboarding, credit risk management, and customer satisfaction improvement.

## **2. Executive Summary**

**Executive Summary – Bank Customer Churn Analysis**

This project analyzes customer churn data for a bank to identify patterns of attrition and recommend strategies for retention. Using Microsoft Excel, an interactive dashboard was built to visualize churn drivers across demographics, financial behavior, satisfaction, and tenure.  

The overall churn rate is **20%**, indicating that one in five customers is leaving the bank. Young customers (20–30 years) show the highest churn (>25%), while older customers (50+) are relatively stable. Financial behavior is a key factor, with customers holding low credit scores (<500) exhibiting churn rates above 35%, compared to less than 20% for high credit score customers (>750). Customers with only one product are at a much higher risk, churning nearly three times more than multi-product holders.  

Customer experience strongly influences churn. Dissatisfied customers (satisfaction scores 1–2) churn at rates above 40%. Similarly, customers in their first 0–2 years of tenure churn the most (>30%), highlighting onboarding as a critical intervention point.  

The dashboard provides a consolidated view of these insights, enabling business leaders to make data-driven decisions on retention strategies. Key recommendations include improving early customer engagement, enhancing satisfaction programs, and targeting high-risk segments based on credit and product holdings.
